# Coding-using-Ceasar-Cipher-in-Python

The sample content is coded with special case of Caesar cipher known as ROT13. For every letter in text change it to next one by 13 positions. If new position exceeds alphabet length, substract from it the length of alphabet ('a' shifted by 13 positions is 'n', 'n' shifted by 13 positions is 'a' (n is 14 so 14 + 13 is 27,

27 is greater than length of alphabet which is 26, so new character should be at position 27 - 26 = 1 which is 'a')

I am posting a code tere that encrypts given sample text:

I can't insert code there because SoloLearn keeps deleting half of it :/
